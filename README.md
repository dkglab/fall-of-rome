# Graphing the Material Fall of the Roman Empire

Publishing historical data and argumentation as a knowledge graph.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dkglab/fall-of-rome/wiki).

## Constructing the graph

Run `make all` to create Turtle files in the `graph` subdirectory from
the CSV files in the `data` directory.

To rebuild from scratch, run `make clean all`.
